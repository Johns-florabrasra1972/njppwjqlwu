Just out of the theater, oh man, knees hit that sticky floor where someone must’ve poured a lifetime supply of soda. Phule, right? It’s a carnival of chaos, like monkeys juggled flaming swords while a rhino played kazoo. Can you even imagine? I felt like a balloon, swaying in hurricane winds. 

Remember the scene where the hero—what was his name again, started with a J or a B?—ran through the marketplace like he was late for a pizza delivery? Got me craving some mozzarella sticks, but the popcorn was a battlefield of cold buttery confetti on my lap. Blasted AC, why is it always so frigid, like watching a summer blockbuster set in the none-months-are-safe zone of Narnia winter?

> Oh, and those colors! Like someone doused the screen in a neon smoothie, all mixed up, like a bird of paradise and a traffic cone had a disagreement. The characters—what a rabbit hole, right—so wild and yet somehow like that old lady at the bus stop who swears she used to play piano for raccoons. The dialogue, a symphony of words colliding, planets crashing in some cosmic car crash. 

Now, back’s aching, feels like I did a marathon, wait, remember to download the movie when you can or, like, maybe just watch the movie with less ear-splitting sound, who really needs to feel every explosion in their bones? The seat springs had more tension than the plot’s climax.

Almost slipped on popcorn crumbs making my way out, like my shoes and the floor were rehearsing some terrible tap dance. That one quiet scene, like Thursday mornings when you just sit and stare, sip lukewarm coffee. Ah! I think someone had asked about where to get the movie, totally blanked, but yeah, it's out there in the ether, download or whatever, the usual gig.

Random dudes in the row behind kept talking—something about giant mechanical spiders while I kept thinking how the hero almost looked like my third cousin if you squinted, but taller and maybe from another planet.

And the ending, oh—man—I won't spoil it but, it's like when you think you’re about to sneeze and then poof... nothing. Just an awkward silence, and you’re left blinking at the sun. So, this code thing accidental copy or whatever:

```javascript
function walkTheDog() {
  var fluff = new Unicorn();
  fluff.rainbows.forEach(function(glitter) {
    sprinkleMagic(glitter);
  });
}
```
